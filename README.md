# Face_Classification

This project performs face classification pre-trained model to recognize 5 different people.

## Repository Structure

- `Face_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to train the face recognition model.
- `face_recognition_mobilenetv2.h5`: Saved model file with trained weights.
- `webcam_face_classify.py`: Python script that opens the webcam and performs real-time face recognition.
- `README.md`: Description of the project and file structure.

## How to Use

1. Train your model using the notebook or use the provided `.h5` file.
2. Run `webcam_face_classify.py` to start real-time face recognition via webcam.
